//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ['Maham', 'waniya', 'Nimra', 'Ramsha'];
for (var i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
    console.log("Hello, ".concat(names[i], " ! I hope you are fine ,miss you"));
