//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything
// specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each
 // program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Addition: Adds two numbers together
console.log(2 + 6);

// Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first
console.log(100 - 92);

// Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together
console.log(8 * 1);

// Division: Divides the first number by the second
console.log(16 / 2);
