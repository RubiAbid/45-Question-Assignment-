/*Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer
 and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information
  and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the 
  information was stored correctly.*/
